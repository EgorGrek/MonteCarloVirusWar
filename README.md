# MonteCarloVirusWar

First, run the program in the botTraining folder,
two bots training will start (they will play against each other)
and then the program will generate a text file with the Monte Carlo tree.
This file should be placed in the game folder.

CLI is used for graphics.
To start the game, you should create a CLI project in Visual Studio 2017 (not tested on others)
replace the automatically created file with the form to MyForm.h, add the other two
file in the project, compile and run.

If the file with the Monte Carlo tree is empty, or the resulting combination in the file is not present, then
the bot will use an elementary algorithm whose code is in Logic.h.

(the file extension attention can not pay,
in .h there is not only declaration, but the whole implementation)
